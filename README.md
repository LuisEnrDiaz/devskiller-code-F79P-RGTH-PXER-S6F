# JavaScript Array Operations

Your task is to implement operations on arrays, perforrming data processing.

# Setup

Follow these steps if you are using zip/git mode (i.e. not available inside Devskiller in-browser IDE):

1. `npm install` – install dependencies
2. `npm test` – run all tests once (this will be used to evaluate your solutions)
3. `npm run test:watch` - run all tests in _watch mode_ (optionally, you can use it locally if you prefer)

# Requirements

Writing functional JavaScript involves understanding our way around pure, high-order functions. The following code you will see is in the form of arrays. Your task is to manipulate the arrays with the named functions. 

1. `function step1()` - Apply the map() function so that it returns every element of the array `numbers` multiplied by 2. 
2. `function step2()` - Apply the map() function to the variable `str` so that every second word in the string is converted to uppercase. 
3. `function step3()` - Remove all the negative numbers from the array `numbers` using the filter() function. 
4. `function step4()` - Find the largest number in the array `numbers` using a reduce() function. It should return null if the array is empty.

## Good luck!
